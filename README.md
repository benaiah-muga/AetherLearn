# AetherLearn: An AI-Powered Learning Co-Pilot

AetherLearn is a next-generation web application that transforms how students learn by creating interactive, personalized learning experiences from any document or topic. Leveraging the Google Gemini API, it allows users to not only understand new subjects but to also track their progress and own their learning journey through a gamified badge system.

## Core Features

-   **Conversational AI Agent (Chat-First Experience):** Interact with an intelligent agent to generate quizzes on any topic. The agent uses Google Search via tool-calling to gather up-to-date information autonomously before creating the quiz.
-   **PDF-Based Quiz Generation:** Upload any PDF document, and AetherLearn will instantly generate a dynamic, interactive quiz based on its content.
-   **Adaptive & Customizable Quizzes:** Tailor quizzes by specifying the difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), number of questions, and desired question types (Multiple Choice, Short Answer, or a Mix).
-   **Intelligent Short-Answer Evaluation:** Instead of relying on exact string matching, AetherLearn uses the Gemini API to intelligently grade short-answer questions, understanding the conceptual correctness of a user's response.
-   **Gamified Learning with Badges:** A comprehensive badge system rewards users for mastery, consistency, performance, and curiosity, keeping them motivated and engaged.
-   **Timed Quizzes:** Users can challenge themselves by taking quizzes under timed conditions to improve their speed and accuracy.
-   **User Profiles & History:** A dedicated profile page tracks all completed quizzes, scores, and time taken, providing a comprehensive overview of a user's learning journey.
-   **Secure Staff Portal:** A separate, login-protected dashboard for administrators to manage the platform (proof-of-concept).

## How It Works

1.  **Choose a Mode:** The user is greeted with the Chat Agent by default but can switch to the PDF-based Quiz Generator.
2.  **Generate a Quiz:**
    -   **Via Chat:** The user asks the AI to create a quiz on a topic (e.g., "Make a 5-question beginner quiz on the Roman Empire"). The AI uses Google Search to find relevant information and generates the quiz.
    -   **Via PDF:** The user uploads a PDF, selects their desired quiz parameters, and generates the quiz.
3.  **Take the Quiz:** The user can opt to start a timer and then proceeds to answer the questions.
4.  **Get Instant Results:** Upon submission, answers are graded (with AI for short answers), and a results page displays the score, percentage, and time taken.
5.  **Earn Badges:** Based on the quiz results and the user's history, the system automatically awards badges for various achievements, displaying a real-time notification.
6.  **Track Progress:** All quiz results and earned badges are available on the user's "My Profile" and "My Badges" pages.
